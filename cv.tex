\section{Intro}

I'm a generalist software developer and a strong supporter of open source. 

My main career goals are to learn new things (ideally bleeding edge tech) and to improve myself.

Recently, I'm focusing on developing (and designing/planning) highly performant \textbf{Go} apps in a microservices, event-driven architecture.

From my past, I have solid experience with \textbf{hadoop} based solutions (the whole ecosystem) and had my share of developing complex parsers in \textbf{C}. 

As for most automation tasks, I'm a \textbf{python} adept (except when a problem can be solved by a \textbf{bash} oneliner).

\section{Some of my interests}

Rust, operational systems, distributed computing, low-level network development, web development
